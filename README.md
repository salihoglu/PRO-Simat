# PRO-Simat
Protein Simulation Analysis Tool
PRO-Simat is a simulation tool for analysing protein interaction networks, 
their dynamic change and pathway engineering.It provides GO enrichment, 
KEGG pathway analyses, and network visualisation from an integrated database of more than 
8 million protein-protein interactions across 32 model organisms and the human proteome.
We integrated dynamical network simulation using the Jimena framework, 
which quickly and efficiently simulates Boolean genetic regulatory networks.
It enables simulation outputs with in-depth analysis of the type, 
strength, duration and pathway of the protein interactions on the website.
Furthermore, the user can efficiently edit and analyse the effect of network modifications and 
engineering experiments.

In case studies, applications of PRO-Simat are demonstrated: 

(i) understanding mutually exclusive differentiation pathways in Bacillus subtilis, 
(ii) making Vaccinia virus oncolytic by switching on its viral replication mainly in cancer
cells and triggering cancer cell apoptosis and 
(iii) optogenetic control of nucleotide processing protein networks to operate DNA storage.
Multilevel communication between components is critical for efficient network switching, 
as demonstrated by a general census on prokaryotic and eukaryotic networks and comparing 
design with synthetic networks using PRO-Simat. 

The tool is available at https://prosimat.heinzelab.de/ as a web-based query server.
